This project was created as an assignment for Dicoding's advanced web development course. Bookshelf Apps is a web application that allows users to keep track of the books they have read. The assignment was to create a web application that allows users to keep track of the books they have read. The app must use localStorage to keep track of the data even after the browser is closed.

The app has two main sections:

1. Add Book: This section allows users to add a new book to their list of books they have read. The fields are simple and easy to use:
   _ Title: The title of the book
   _ Writer: The author of the book
   _ Year: The year the book was published
   _ Checkbox: Mark this if you have finished reading the book

2. Book Lists: This section shows two lists of books the user has read. The lists are:
   - Sedang dibaca: This list shows the books that the user is currently reading.
   - Selesai dibaca: This list shows the books that the user has finished reading.

The app also allows users to:

The app is fully responsive and works well on both desktop and mobile devices. Whether you're using a computer, tablet, or smartphone, the app is easy to use and gets out of the way so you can focus on reading.

The code is well commented so you can easily understand how the app works. If you have any questions or need help understanding the code, feel free to ask!
